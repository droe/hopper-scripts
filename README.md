## Description

Some of my Hopper scripts that are polished and general enough to be
potentially useful to others.  They used to run on Hopper 4 on macOS and
Linux and are slowly being fixed for Hopper 5 and Python 3.

The scripts use a nicer wrapper API around the strictly procedural Hopper
python API, otherwise the scripts are self-contained.

## Scripts

-   **Analyze Shellcode** - detect and annotate typical shellcode patterns:
    known code blocks, call import by hash, and call/pop reg
-   **Annotate Stack Strings in Selection** - annotate plaintext and
    XOR-encrypted stack strings
-   **Annotate Yara Matches** - apply a set of yara rules to the currently
    loaded document and annotate a summary of matching rules as well as each
    string occurence for matching rules
-   **Copy Selection As Python** - copy bytes in current selection to the
    clipboard, in python syntax, with assembly code in comments
-   **Copy Selection As Yara** - copy bytes in current selection to the
    clipboard, in yara syntax, with assembly code in comments
-   **File Offset Here** - add a prefix comment with the file offset at the
    current cursor position
-   **Fix Imports By Ordinal** - rename labels of imported functions by ordinal
    to their actual names
-   **Save Bytes From Here** - carve and save an arbitrarily-sized blob of
    optionally XOR-decrypted bytes from the current cursor position to a file
